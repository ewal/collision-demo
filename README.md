# Demo project

This project is just made to show random collision detection failures.

## Testing instructions
Move around with `A` and `D`. Hold `O` to sprint and `P` to "jump" (rather, it just moves the Actor up the Y axis for this demo purpose).

While high in the air, let got of the jump button. From time to time, the Actor will fall through the floor.

The yellow box is a manually added box collider.
